# POKÉDEX

## Presentation

The Pokédex is a backend focused project made to showcase my ability to build API and efficiently communicate with the front-end. This project was made in 5 days.    

The features include : Authentification, API calls to fetch, create, update and delete teams, adding pokemon to a team we own, pagination in pokemon list and search system with filters.
